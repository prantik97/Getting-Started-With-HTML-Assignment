    <h1>Python (programming language)</h1>
    <hr>
    <h3>Overview: </h3>
    <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability
        with the use of significant indentation.
        <br>
        Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including
        structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a
        "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

    <h3>History: </h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the
        Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception
        handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989.
        <br> Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he
        announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's "benevolent dictator for life", a title
        the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief
        decision-maker. In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to
        lead the project.
